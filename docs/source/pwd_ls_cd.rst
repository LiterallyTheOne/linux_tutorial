Navigation wih pwd, ls, cd
==========================

To start with linux, first we need to learn how to
navigate through files.
In order to do that we mostly use these three commands:

* ``pwd``: To find out where you are
* ``ls``: To find out the content of the current directory
* ``cd``: To change the current directory

In these tutorial we discuss about these three commands.

pwd

``pwd`` stands for **Print Working Directory**.
And by the sounds of it, it prints the current
directory. for example if we are right now in
``/home/ramin`` (ramin is my name by the way)
the result of typing ``pwd`` in terminal and pressing
enter would be: ``/home/ramin``
