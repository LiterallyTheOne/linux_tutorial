Navigation wih pwd, ls, cd
==========================

To start with linux, first we need to learn how to
navigate through files.
In order to do that we mostly use these three commands:

* ``pwd``: To find out where you are
* ``ls``: To find out the content of the current directory
* ``cd``: To change the current directory

In these tutorial we discuss about these three commands.
